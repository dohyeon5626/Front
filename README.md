# Frontend

It is a repository that uploads what I made in html, CSS and JavaScript

### [html](https://github.com/dohyeon5626/Frontend/tree/main/html)

This directory contains files created with **Html**

### [CSS](https://github.com/dohyeon5626/Frontend/tree/main/CSS)

This directory contains files created with **Css**

### [JavaScript](https://github.com/dohyeon5626/Frontend/tree/main/JavaScript)

This directory contains files created with **Javascript**

### [front-training](https://github.com/dohyeon5626/Frontend/tree/main/front-training)

This directory contains files created using both **Html**, **Css**, and **Javascript**

- [**Scientist Flow**](https://github.com/dohyeon5626/Frontend/tree/main/front-training/Scientist%20Flow_2021_01_01)

  The project uses **slider**s to show the names of scientists

- [**오목**](https://github.com/dohyeon5626/Frontend/tree/main/front-training/%EC%98%A4%EB%AA%A9_2020_12_27)

  This project was made to complement the **Omok** made in the C language that I showed you before
  The previously made omok had the disadvantage of having to enter the coordinates directly and having two players to play the game
  Thus, the project was created in a **GUI environment**, and a **single-person version** was added to allow the user to play alone
